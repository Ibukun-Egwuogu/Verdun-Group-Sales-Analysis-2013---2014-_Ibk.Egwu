**Recommendations for Verdun Group**

**Maximize Profitability from the Government Segment:**

Since the Government segment contributed the highest sales ($52M), Verdun Group should strengthen partnerships with government entities by offering tailored solutions, exclusive products, or bulk discounts to retain and grow this segment.
 

**Revitalize the Channel Partners Segment:**

With only $2M in sales, the Channel Partners segment requires attention. Introduce incentive programs, increase marketing efforts, or re-evaluate the product mix offered to this segment to boost engagement and revenue.
 

**Focus on Top-Performing Products:**

Paseo leads both sales ($30.5M) and profit ($4.3M). Capitalize on its success by increasing production capacity, enhancing marketing efforts, and exploring opportunities for geographic expansion.
For products with lower sales and profits like Carretera ($13.1M sales, $1.5M profit), consider revisiting pricing strategies or exploring opportunities to improve appeal through redesigns or marketing campaigns.
 

**Leverage High Discount Band Profitability:**

The High discount band generated the highest profit ($6.19M, 40.83%). Verdun Group should analyze its success and replicate this discounting strategy across other underperforming products or customer segments while maintaining profitability margins.
 

**Enhance Sales in Small Business and Enterprise Segments:**

The Small Business segment performed well ($46M sales) but has room for further growth. Verdun Group should target this segment with tailored marketing campaigns or financing options to encourage higher product uptake.
For Enterprise, invest in building stronger relationships, offering customized deals, or focusing on products that resonate with this segment to increase its contribution beyond $9M.
 

**Capitalize on 2014’s Performance for Sustained Growth:**

Since 2014 accounted for 76.77% of the profit ($11.64M), Verdun Group should analyze the specific strategies, product promotions, or market dynamics responsible for this success. Replicate these strategies to maintain momentum in future years.
 

**Optimize Resource Allocation Across Products:**

Unit sales are relatively balanced across most products (137K–155K units). Verdun Group should ensure efficient production and inventory management to meet demand while prioritizing high-margin products like Paseo.
 

**Improve Marketing for Low-Selling Products:**

For products like Carretera with lower sales ($13.1M) and profits, introduce targeted campaigns, bundle offers, or limited-edition versions to create demand and differentiate from competitors.
